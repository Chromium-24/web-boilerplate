/// Objects may be used in any number of unrelated contexts to the one you can
/// currently see it in. Making modifications to these types of class could
/// potentially lead to unintended results in a lot of other unrelated places.
/// Tread carefully.
///
/// - Objects are abstract
/// - They can be used in any number of places across the project â€” places you
///   might not have even seen
/// - Avoid modifying their styles
/// - Be careful around anything with a lower-case classname
///
/// ### Format
/// `.object-name[<element>|<modifier>] {}`
///
/// ### Example
/// ```
/// .layout {}
/// .layout__item {}
/// .layout--fixed {}
/// ```
